## [pyArchitect](https://github.com/romangolev/pyArchitect) update v1.1.0

Spend some time recently on revising code and debugging tools. Completely rewrite logic for some tools and implemented new approach for selecting elements. Now it's possible to pick elements after firing a tool button. Fixed some bugs and finished Copy Parameters tool. 
All additional information comes on github release [here](https://github.com/romangolev/pyArchitect/releases/tag/v1.1.0). 
The documentation for the tool can be found [here](https://romangolev.github.io/pyArchitect/)
By the way, in a new version of pyRevit (v4.8.13.23182 or higher) you may install pyArchitect straight away using pyRevit extensions manager. The instructions can be found [here](https://pyrevitlabs.notion.site/Install-Extensions-0753ab78c0ce46149f962acc50892491)
