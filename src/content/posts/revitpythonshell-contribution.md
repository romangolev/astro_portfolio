## What is RevitPythonShell?

[RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell) is an IronPython scripting environment for Autodesk Revit. It provides an interactive shell where you can write and execute Python code directly within Revit, making it an invaluable tool for:

- Rapid prototyping of Revit API scripts
- Exploring the Revit API interactively
- Automating one-off tasks without creating full add-ins
- Learning the Revit API in a hands-on way

## My Contributions

I've been contributing to RevitPythonShell to help keep it updated and functional for newer Revit versions. The project has a dedicated community of BIM developers who rely on it for their daily workflows.

## Why This Matters

Open-source tools like RevitPythonShell lower the barrier to entry for BIM automation. Before tools like this existed, automating Revit required:

- Visual Studio setup
- C# knowledge
- Understanding of .NET compilation
- Complex deployment processes

With RevitPythonShell, anyone with basic Python knowledge can start automating Revit immediately.

## Get Involved

The project is always looking for contributors. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation - every contribution helps the AEC community.
