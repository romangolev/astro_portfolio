## Overview

**NavisTools** is an add-in for Autodesk Navisworks that extends its native functionality with additional tools for BIM coordination workflows. Built during my time as a BIM Coordinator, this toolset addresses common pain points in model coordination and data management.

## Features

- **Enhanced Data Export** - Export model data in various formats for reporting and analysis
- **Coordination Tools** - Streamlined clash detection and resolution workflows
- **Custom Selection Sets** - Advanced filtering and selection capabilities
- **Batch Operations** - Automate repetitive tasks across multiple models

## Technical Details

The add-in is developed using C# and the Navisworks .NET API. It follows the MVVM pattern for the WPF-based user interface, ensuring maintainable and testable code.

## Get Started

The source code is available on GitHub under an open-source license.
