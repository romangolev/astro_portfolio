## About pyRevit

**pyRevit** is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment for Autodesk Revit. It allows developers and power users to create tools and extensions using Python scripts without the need to compile code or deal with complex deployment processes.

## My Contribution: C# Loader

I developed the **C# loader** for pyRevit, a significant architectural component that extends pyRevit's capabilities beyond Python scripting. The C# loader enables developers to:

- Write pyRevit extensions in C# for better performance and type safety
- Leverage the full .NET ecosystem while maintaining pyRevit's rapid development workflow
- Integrate compiled C# libraries directly into pyRevit's extension system
- Access low-level Revit API features with compiled code efficiency

This contribution bridges the gap between pyRevit's Python simplicity and the power of compiled C# code, giving developers flexibility to choose the right tool for their use case.

## Why pyRevit Matters

pyRevit has transformed how BIM professionals approach automation in Revit:

- **Low barrier to entry** - Write Python scripts without C# compilation
- **Rapid iteration** - Test changes instantly without restarting Revit
- **Active community** - Large ecosystem of shared tools and extensions
- **Production-ready** - Used by thousands of AEC professionals worldwide
